You have a hash of keys that are users and values that are hashes of their movie ratings (also in the form of a hash). 
The userâ€™s movie ratings are also in a hash of key value pairs of movie names and ratings from 1 to 10. 
Create a hash containing the average ratings for each movies generated from the ratings made by all the users in the input.
